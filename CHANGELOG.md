## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A separate `dangd` server-application foundation with startup model and
  configuration validation, datastore snapshot lifecycle support, and a
  supervised stream integration mode.
- A reusable running-configuration backend notification boundary driven by
  exact schema-aware diffs whenever the effective running datastore changes.
- Initial C++20 YANG/YIN compiler, effective-schema model, configuration
  validation and editing libraries, and transport-neutral NETCONF stack.
- RFC 6241 datastores and operations, RFC 6242 framing, RFC 6243 defaults,
  RFC 5277 notifications, RFC 8341 NACM, persistence, filters, resource limits,
  fuzzing, sanitizers, and deterministic benchmarks.
- Mutual-TLS `dangd` listening, certificate-to-NETCONF identity handoff, NACM
  policy loading, and the interactive `dangctl` XML paste-and-reply client,
  with test-only certificates and RFC 8341 model fixtures.

### Fixed

- Applied deferred GoogleTest discovery to every sanitizer-instrumented test
  target on macOS, avoiding false container-overflow failures from linking an
  instrumented executable with Homebrew's prebuilt GoogleTest.
- Corrected edit authorization to compare its iterator against the exact
  change set being searched, avoiding undefined behavior for denied edits.
- Ensured transport adapters flush a successful `close-session` reply before
  shutting down the underlying SSH or TLS stream.

### Tests

- Added NETCONF error-interaction coverage proving that invalid edit targets
  and schema-invalid candidate commits fail without publishing backend state.

### Changed

- NETCONF validation error messages now include the defining YANG module and
  instance path when available, making model failures directly actionable.

### Documentation

- Added a users guide that explains the library and host-application layers,
  then walks through model loading, validation, NETCONF edits and commits,
  diagnostics, persistence, and integration using `dangd` as the example.
- Expanded Doxygen across all library and `dangd` source files, completed the
  daemon's public API contracts, and made documentation warnings fail the build.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- First development release of the complete library foundation.
