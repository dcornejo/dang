## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A separate `dangd` server-application foundation with startup model and
  configuration validation, datastore snapshot lifecycle support, and a
  supervised stream integration mode.
- A reusable running-configuration backend notification boundary driven by
  exact schema-aware diffs whenever the effective running datastore changes.
- Initial C++20 YANG/YIN compiler, effective-schema model, configuration
  validation and editing libraries, and transport-neutral NETCONF stack.
- RFC 6241 datastores and operations, RFC 6242 framing, RFC 6243 defaults,
  RFC 5277 notifications, RFC 8341 NACM, persistence, filters, resource limits,
  fuzzing, sanitizers, and deterministic benchmarks.

### Fixed

- Applied deferred GoogleTest discovery to every sanitizer-instrumented test
  target on macOS, avoiding false container-overflow failures from linking an
  instrumented executable with Homebrew's prebuilt GoogleTest.
- Corrected edit authorization to compare its iterator against the exact
  change set being searched, avoiding undefined behavior for denied edits.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added
